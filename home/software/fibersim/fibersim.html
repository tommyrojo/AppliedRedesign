						<p><h1>Capabilities of Fibersim</h1></p>
						
						<p>Fibersim provides a specialized engineering environment integrated into your CAD system that supports the entire composites engineering process, from the preliminary stages of design through detailed design, analysis and manufacturing.</p>

						<p>The Fibersim portfolio of software for composites engineering from Siemens PLM Software significantly reduces the cost and time required to design and manufacture innovative, durable and lightweight composite structures. Fibersim, which is integrated into popular 3D CAD systems, improves the entire composites engineering process by helping you quickly create and transition accurate designs, drawings and related data from preliminary design through detailed design and, ultimately, onto the manufacturing floor. You can interact with your familiar CAD user interface, using standard and custom menus. Fibersim evaluates native CAD geometry and displays results within the CAD system without translation or approximation.</p>

						<p><strong>Benefits of Fibersim:</strong><ul>
						<li>Reduce material necessary to achieve required strength/stiffness</li>
						<li>Achieve higher production rates and decrease assembly costs</li>
						<li>Eliminate manual data entry errors</li>
						<li>Alleviate communication barriers between analysts and engineers</li></ul></p>

						<p><strong>Features of Fibersim:</strong><ul>
						<li>Enables selection of best-in-class CAE and CAD tools</li>
						<li>Delivers a high-definition user experience</li>
						<li>Ensures an accurate, bi-directional exchange of CAE and CAD composite part definitions</li>
						<li>Introduces design for manufacturing support</li>
						<li>Offers expanded Teamcenter integration</li></ul></p>

						<p><strong>Fibersim Modules</strong></p>
						<p>The Composite Engineering Environment and Advanced Composite Engineering Environment are modules in the Fibersim portfolio. The Composite Engineering Environment (CEE) is for general purposes while the Advanced Composite Engineering Environment (ACEE) is for large complex structures. Both modules are integrated into the NX, Catia and Creo Parametric (formerly Pro/Engineer) CAD systems. In addition, a variety of optional products that enhance these base products are also available.</p>

						<p><strong>Composite Engineering Environment</strong></p>
						<p>CEE increases engineering productivity by transforming your existing CAD system into a high-performance tool for designing and manufacturing composite parts. Engineers at leading aerospace, automotive, wind energy and marine companies have used CEE to generate better designs by taking advantage of its specialized tools to meet the challenges of working with advanced materials. Not only has CEE enabled engineers to optimize designs, it has also reduced development time, material waste, design revisions, tooling costs and manufacturing time. The key capabilities and attributes include:<ul>
						<li>3D ply definition</li>
						<li>Laminate analysis</li>
						<li>Productivity assessment</li>
						<li>Generation of 3D flat patterns</li>
						<li>Open architecture</li></ul></p>

						<p><strong>Advanced Composite Engineering Environment</strong></p>
						<p>ACEE provides a flexible and automated environment for defining complex parts. The software is flexible enough to easily accommodate the demands of designing a wide variety of composite parts and the complete range of materials and manufacturing processes used to create them. Automation tools in ACEE reduce potential for error and, by speeding the design process, leave engineers free to focus their expertise on design innovation, process selection, part performance and quality. ACEE features four main categories of tools for preliminary design and automation:<ul>
						<li>Specialized design methods for defining industry- and part-specific laminate specifications and requirements</li>
						<li>Dynamic generation of ply boundaries and drop-offs</li>
						<li>Generation of variable offset surfaces</li></ul></p>

						<p><h1>What's New in Fibersim 13</h1></p>
						<p>The new version of the Fibersim™ portfolio of software for composites engineering provides design engineers with a powerful decision support environment for optimizing products by enabling them to import and update their CAD model from the CAE composite part representation. The feedback loop created by this process enables engineers to make smarter decisions that result in better products by delivering relevant information in context when they need it. Fibersim 13 also supports novel composite design for manufacturing techniques and improved integration with Teamcenter® software.</p>
						<p>The new version of Fibersim eliminates manual data entry errors and breaks down the communication barriers between stress analysts and design engineers, which is critical to making informed decisions that result in optimized parts.</p>
						<p>Fibersim 13 uses a new, high performance open format in its Analysis Interface that allows for composite information to be defined and communicated between the stress analyst and the design engineer. This thought-leading, open format has been widely adopted by best-in-class CAE solutions, enabling customers to work with the tools they want to use.</p>
						<p>Fibersim 13 provides a high definition (HD) user experience for visualizing and refining imported CAE ply boundary definitions and incorporating them into the master model definition. It enables design engineers to preview and visualize composite plies and boundaries, as defined in CAE within the CAD design environment. Design engineers can compare the updated CAE design to the existing CAD design to quickly identify differences between the representations and efficiently understand what needs to be integrated into the CAD design.</p>
						<p>In addition, the Fibersim 13 Analysis Interface enables the bi-directional exchange of CAE and CAD composite data. Data exchanged includes composite part metadata and geometric representations for plies and cores and eliminates the need for interpretation and manual data re-entry.</p>
						<p>The new version of Fibersim introduces design support for parts designed to the manufacturing extended definition. Most parts are defined to their engineering net definition and then extended to incorporate manufacturing excess. Companies have found that many part types do not lend themselves to this standard design approach and, instead, are best designed to the manufacturing extended definition and then trimmed to the engineering net definition. These parts have zone representations that extend beyond the engineering net boundary to the extended manufacturing boundary. The parts are designed in this manner so minimum weight can be achieved while maintaining standard transition offset requirements. Fibersim 13 provides native functionality to support these design workflows.</p>
						<p>Fibersim 13 also expands upon the current ability to manage the revisions of composite CAD models from NX, Catia and Creo within Teamcenter. Fibersim 13 extends this capability by enabling derivative manufacturing data files to be automatically associated with the model’s revision within Teamcenter. This ensures full revision management of all of the derivative data sets generated by Fibersim while also associating the files to the master composite part definition model.</p>
