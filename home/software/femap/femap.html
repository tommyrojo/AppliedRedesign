						<p><h1>Femap Version 11</h1></p>
						<p>Since its inception, Femap development has been driven by the needs of our customers to solve increasingly complex engineering problems, and have been delivered with regular software updates. Version 11 is no exception.</p>
						<p>Enhanced Productivity through Performance Improvements</p>
						<p>Femap version 11 provides more efficient access and processing of results data by attaching results data files, rather than importing the data into the Femap database. This minimizes database size and improves accessibility and speed of results processing. Femap 11 also increases performance of graphical data access and display by taking advantage of graphics card memory, which significantly improves dynamic rotation of large models.</p>
						<p>Increased Simulation Scope with External Superelement Support</p>
						<p>External superelements provide a method of passing structural data in matrix form only to maintain confidentiality. In Femap version 11, the external superelement creation and subsequent analysis in an assembly run is now supported, making it much easier to set up and process external superelements.</p>
 						<p>Easier Legacy Model Edits with Geometry Creation from Mesh</p>
						<p>Femap version 11 delivers a method of creating surface geometry straight from an existing shell mesh, allowing legacy finite element models to be modified and updated much more easily. You can take an existing shell model, create new surface geometry, apply any necessary modifications or updates, and then remesh to create a new shell model.</p>
 						<p>Easier Results Comprehension with Streamlined XY Plotting</p>
						<p>In Femap version 11, the XY plotting is streamlined to facilitate XY plot creation and aid comprehension of the results data. User control of graphing options has been extended, allowing greater flexibility of results XY plot creation.</p>
						<p>NX Nastran Integration and Customer-Driven Enhancements</p>
						<p>Femap version 11 ships with NX Nastran 8.5 and extends support of NX Nastran, further tightening the integration between the pre- and postprocessor and solver. In addition, there are numerous other customer-driven enhancements that aid meshing, add analysis functionality, improve model visualization and expand usability.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="landing-content-right-swap-4" style="display: none	">
						<p><h1>Femap with NX Nastran</h1></p>
						<p>Interactively supports a broad range of capabilities</p>
						<p>The range of capabilities in the base module includes linear and statics, normal modes, buckling, basic nonlinear and heat transfer. In addition NX Nastran for Femap includes additional options for dynamics – that includes transient/dynamic, frequency/harmonic response, response spectrum, random response DDAM (Dynamic Design Analysis Method) – as well as advanced nonlinear analysis, aeroelasticity, superelements, optimization, rotor dynamics and DMAP (Direct Matrix Abstraction Program).</p>
						<p>The product configuration provides a wealth of functionality in the base module as well as allowing for great flexibility and scalability extending to the most advanced types of analysis that are able to handle the toughest engineering problems.</p>
						<p>Integration with NX Nastran</p>
						<p>Femap has a 15 year history of working as a pre- and post processor to Nastran. In addition to NX Nastran, Femap is also able to support other versions of Nastran including MSC/MD Nastran and NEiNastran. All of these solvers can be easily encapsulated within Femap while providing a high degree of solution control to the user.</p>
						<p>Detailed and complete NX Nastran controls</p>
						<p>Within Femap it is possible to directly define & control most aspects of the NX Nastran simulation. From controlling the solution options (such as defining an iterative solution), param keyword settings, specific job controls (such as restart controls, executive controls & manual controls with DMAP), case controls (load and constraint definition), model checking (geomcheck controls, weight & ground checks), and detailed result generation requests.</p>
						<p>VisQ solution job management</p>
						<p>VisQ actively manages NX Nastran solutions from Femap, and provides users with advanced tools to define, schedule and track simulations</p>
