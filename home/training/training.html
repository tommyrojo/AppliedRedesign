We can come onsite for dedicated training classes and then be available for over-the-shoulder mentoring to help users get over the little hurdles that tend to make new releases troublesome. We prefer to MBWA (mentor by walking around) to make sure the training sticks and your users are productive from Go Live. Email and phone support is average. Having somebody to field a quick question and get your users going again is progress.</p>

                                                    Description: This course introduces the basic and intermediate level uses of modeling, assemblies, drafting, sheet metal applications, and even introduces Synchronous modeling techniques. This course is based on real world use, and features tasks designers and engineers face in their day to day work. Instructor led portions are interspersed with project style application use. After attending this class you should be able to roll up your sleeves and start designing in NX.

                                                    Prerequisite: prior understanding and experience with the fundamentals of solid modeling and drafting. You have used another 3D parametric CAD package before (Pro/E, I-deas, Catia, Solidworks, etc). This could be a good upgrade class if you are working in 2 or more releases behind the current release of NX.

                                                Description: This class introduces the concepts of Synchronous Modeling and the tools that allow direct editing of geometry, even on imported/feature-less models. You will learn which commands are functional in History and History Free modes. Sample projects and use cases will be worked in class and strategy to employ. Upon completion of this course you will be able to start working confidently with this powerful tool set.

                                            <p>The course is a comprehensive presentation of the dynamic capabilities available in NX Nastran. It covers both fundamental and advanced topics with an emphasis on practical applications and example problems.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                The class is focused on the application of NX Nastran to solve real world dynamics problems. The fundamentals of structural dynamics and the application of numerical methods to solve dynamics problems are covered. The theory is then applied to the solution of real world dynamics problems using the dynamic analysis capabilities of NX Nastran. Delivery is performed in the context of NX Nastran ASCII input and output files and not in the context of commercially available pre- and post-processors.
